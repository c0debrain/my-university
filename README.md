# my-university
Simple web app using Meteor.js, React.js and Bootstrap 4, made on request.

## The concept
I created this web application by request of a frienid of mine and his team. The concept is to create a web application that has "profile" pages for certain universities in the USA, allow user registration, and show the user which universities they could hope to enter into based on their personal profile grades. The data and images used in this project were submitted by my friends' team and I can not vouch for their validity or accuracy. I undertook this project to further my skills in web development.
